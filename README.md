# The Buffyverse API

Little application to show Node, MongoDB, Express. And to create a Buffy API for fun!

    I may be dead, but I’m still pretty. - Buffy

    Yes, it’s terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, uh, we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after. - Giles
